Verlexin: "bad gateway //502/ was my first collaboration song, and it is very cool to see it in BMS! Thank you echa and halorime for your hard work in this submission! <3"

volts: "mrrp :3! Thanks to echa and halorime for charting & making the bga of our track! This was made with the theme of "being lost in space", and there are a few easter eggs in the break section (wink wink!) Its incredible to see something I worked on being in BMS, so once again, thank you so much to echa and halorime!"

Echa: "I am glad I met Verlexin in probably one of the most unexpected ways possible. When some of my works were cancelled or just wouldn't be finished, I decided to look through Verlexin's discography. Eventually 'bad gateway //502/' would catch my eye eventually and I decided to contact Verlexin if it would be possible to turn it into a BMS entry for LBMSE!3. As far as I know, the entire project was actually somewhat salvaged due to it not being entirely new, but a short version was made and surprisingly, it was the easiest thing to keysound. Charting took some time but I enjoyed the process. I hope I can work with Verlexin, volts, halorime & Synthix. in the future again!"

halorime: ""
